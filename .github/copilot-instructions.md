# Copilot Instructions

We use `bun` for package management in JavaScript/TypeScript projects, not `npm`. When suggesting package installation or management commands, always use:
- `bun add` for installing packages
- `bun install` for installing dependencies  
- `bun run` for running scripts
- `bun remove` for removing packages

Never suggest `npm` commands unless specifically asked about npm.
